//ðŸ”´ NOTE: We are not using two loops approach because it can be done with one traversal, 
//approach being that if today's price is lower than last buy price then update buyDay because if there would 
//have been any profit it must have been stored in maxProfit variable and now we need to calculate maxProfit from this day
